Higher Order Components:

HOCs are used to create a component that provides resuable logic 
to other components.

HOC is a function that takes a component as an input and 
return a new component by providing some functionalities.



Redux: 

Redux is a library which is used to implement application state management. 

Redux seperates out the logic of the application vs the UI Representation. 

The data management will be taken care by Redux and React takes care of displaying the content on the UI.

To work with redux, we need to install redux and react-redux libraries.

Redux Terminology:

1. Store : Maintains the application state.

2. Root Reducer: Root reducer is responsible to prepare the application state.

3. Reducer : Reducer is responsible to generate a part of application state.

4. Action : When user makes an action (clicking on a button), then the action takes care of handling it. 

Mostly, we will make API calls using actions 

5. Container: Any component that interacts with redux can be considered as Container. 



Workflow:

Container -> Action -> Reducer -> Root Reducer -> Store

Any component that wants to access the application data, will interact with store.
