Different types of Errors:

Debugging:

It is the process to find the reason for the bug in 
the code. 

Browsers provide debugging capabilities. 

Garbage Collection:

Garbage collection is the process where the unused / unreferenced objects 
are removed from the memory. 

Runtime engine uses garabage collector to collect the 
garbage from the memory. 

The runtime engine has a threshold(like 80%) , whenever 
the limit reaches the threshold then runtime engine 
calls the garbage collector. 

As a developer, we need to write the garbage friendly code. 
var employee = {
            name: "kiran"
        }
        console.log(employee);
        employee = null; // nullification 
        console.log(employee); 

Best coding Practices:

1. Add the comments wherever required. 

2. use meaningful names for variables. 

3. follow the camelCase for functions and make sure 
the functions are verb. 

4. use tools like JSLint which helps in coding standards. 

5. do not provide multiple functionalities in a 
single function instead follow single responsbility rule. 

6. The single responsbility rules says not to provide 
multiple functionalities in a single function. 

7. Do not use == , instead use  ===.

8. use regular expressions instead of javascript logic 
for the validations. 

9.
