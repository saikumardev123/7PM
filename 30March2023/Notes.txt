Error Handling:

when ever an error occurs the program will be terminated abnormally.

Error handling is the process of skipping the code that is raising an error and 
executing the rest of code. 

Error handling is not fixing the issue instead we are skipping the part of the code 
and continuing the rest of the execution. 

<html>

<head>

</head>

<body>

    <script>

        var a = 100, b = 200;
        var c;

        console.log(a); // 100
        try {
            console.log(c); //
            console.log(a * a);
        }
        catch (error) {
            console.log(error);
        }
        console.log(a + b);
        console.log("open database connection");

    </script>

</body>

</html>

We handle the exceptions by using try catch mechanism. 

whatever the code that might raise an error, that code should be put in try block.

and try block should have a catch block followed to handle the error. 

   try {
            console.log(c); //
            console.log(a * a);
        }
        catch (error) {
            console.log(error);
        }
