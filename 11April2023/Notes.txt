React: 

React.js is a front end library which is used to develop resuable user interface 
components. 

React.js is popular because of its faster loading of content/ data on the UI. 

As a modern library, it needs to support Single Page Application.

Any Application that we create using react will be called as package. 

npm: node package manager - manages the developed / developing packages. 

npx: node package execute - used to create any application without installing the 
software globally.
