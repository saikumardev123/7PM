Custom Interpolation:

In String Interpolation, we can write free style of text. however,we need 
to include some dynamic content in to the String, then we need to use 
custom interpolation. 


<html>

<head>

</head>

<body>

    <script>

        var name = "Rajesh";
        var role = "Lead Full Stack Developer";
        var regards = "Kiran";

        var str = `Hello ${name}, 
                         
              You have been promoted to ${role} and your ctc is revised. 

                Thanks,
               ${regards}

`;

        console.log(str);


    </script>

</body>

</html>
var employees = [
    {
        name: "kiran", 
        hike:"10%",
        role: "full stack dev", 
        currentCTC: "10LPA", 
        revisedCTC: "11LPA", 
        manager: "Rajesh"
    },
    {
        name: "Nikhil", 
        hike:"100%",
        role: " junior full stack dev", 
        currentCTC: "3LPA", 
        revisedCTC: "6LPA", 
        manager: "Anil"
    },
    {
        name: "Anil", 
        hike:"5%",
        role: "manager", 
        currentCTC: "20LPA", 
        revisedCTC: "21LPA", 
        manager: "Nitish"
    }
]

Create a template and iterate the array by dynamically passing the values 
using custom interpolation. 


 Hello <>, 

   your hike is <>, The current ctc is <> and revised is <>. 

   Your role is <>. 

   Thanks, 
   <manager>

<script>
    var employees = [
    {
        name: "kiran", 
        hike:"10%",
        role: "full stack dev", 
        currentCTC: "10LPA", 
        revisedCTC: "11LPA", 
        manager: "Rajesh"
    },
    {
        name: "Nikhil", 
        hike:"100%",
        role: " junior full stack dev", 
        currentCTC: "3LPA", 
        revisedCTC: "6LPA", 
        manager: "Anil"
    },
    {
        name: "Anil", 
        hike:"5%",
        role: "manager", 
        currentCTC: "20LPA", 
        revisedCTC: "21LPA", 
        manager: "Nitish"
    }
];

     employees.map((employee)=>{
       var template = `Hello ${employee.name}, 
your hike is ${employee.hike}, The current ctc is ${employee.currentCTC} and revised is ${employee.revisedCTC}. 
Your role is ${employee.role}. 
Thanks,
