Composition vs Inheritance:

Inheritance:

It is the process of resusing the resources of one class in another 
class. 

A class extends another class to use the resources. 


class A{

}
class C{

}
class B extends A,C{

}


Composition:

It also the process of resuing the resources but Composition does not 
allow extension of resources instead inclusion of resources is done. 


class A{

}
class B{

}
class C{

}
class D{
       A;
       B;
       C;
       D;
}
