React :

Strength: Updating/displaying the content on the UI in a lightning speed.

React is not developed for the purpose of data management.


Redux: 

Redux is a application state management library used to manage the application data. 

Store: Is the place where the application state is available.

root reducer: responsible to gather multiple reducers and put all the reducers under one object(application state) and 
provide it to Store.

reducer: responsible to gather the data from action.


action: responsible to prepare the data (make API call and gather the data) and send it to reducer

container: its a component, which is responsible to connect the action with the user action.

It follows a simple workflow:


Container -> action -> reducer -> root reducer -> store 

Container -> store
