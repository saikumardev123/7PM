First class functions:

In JS, the functions are given the top most priority because JS encourages 
the developers to implement functionality of an application using 
functions.

In JS, A function can be passed as an argument, store the function in a variable
and we can return a function from another functions. 

IIFE: Immediately invoked function expression. 

Sometimes, we need a function to be automatically executed irrespective of 
calling it and this function should be executed only once. 

These can also be called as self invoking functions.

syntax:

 (function(){
 // code
 })();

<head>

</head>

 <body>

     <script>

           (function(){
               console.log("I am IIFE");
           })();

     </script>
